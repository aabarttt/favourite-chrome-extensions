# favourite-chrome-extensions
Here are my favorite chrome extensions i use for fun and for blocking my procrastination.

some of them i've learned from youtube, i don't remember particular video but i want to admit it helped me a lot.

 - chrome_crasher o matter what person is doing on chrome will display 404 issue
i personaly recomend to install chrome_crasher on your friends computer and have fun from his/her frustration :D

 - lana_rhoades will replace every #img with Lana Rhoades image 
you can always add new photo links in js file

 - procrastinatiion_bloker was made to direct your attension on work you have to do
