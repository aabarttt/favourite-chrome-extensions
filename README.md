# favourite-chrome-extensions
Here are my favorite chrome extensions i use for fun and for blocking my procrastination.

some of them i've learned from youtube, i don't remember particular video but i want to admit it helped me a lot.

i personaly recomend to install chrome_crasher on your friends computer and have fun from his/her frustration :D
